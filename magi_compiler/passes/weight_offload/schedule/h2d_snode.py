"""Recognizing a weight load among scheduler nodes.

Lives on its own because two passes need it and neither owns it: the load
reorder has to find the loads it places, and the all-gather reorder has to know
a load is NOT compute -- counting a PCIe transfer as compute that hides a
collective double-spends the same microseconds on two different transfers.
