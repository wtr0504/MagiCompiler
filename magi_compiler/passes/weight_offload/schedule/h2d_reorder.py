"""Second-phase reorder: hoist each weight load off the gather it feeds.

Installed AFTER ``FsdpOverlapReorder`` in
``reorder_for_compute_comm_overlap_passes``; Inductor chains the passes
(``order = p(order)``), so this one sees the all-gather placement the first pass
settled on.  Compute is priced by the ``SnodeCostTable`` that ``SnodeCostProfile``
filled at the head of the chain; a load's own transfer is priced here, from its
bytes and the configured bandwidth.

Phase 1 moves ``h2d_load``, its wait and the all-gather as one block, which is
correct but leaves the load fully exposed: the wait sits directly in front of the
gather, so the compute stream stalls for the whole transfer before the gather is
even issued.  This pass pulls the load -- and only the load -- back out of that
block, opening a window of compute between it and its wait::

    ... compute ...  h2d_load  ... compute ...  h2d_wait  all_gather  ...
                     ^ moved here             ^ left where phase 1 put it

What a step can overlap at all
------------------------------

Before choosing where any load goes, there is a question of whether they can
fit: with ``C`` ns of compute in the step and a bus running at ``B`` bytes/ns,
no placement can hide more than ``C * B`` bytes of transfer.  Anything past that
is exposed wherever it is put, and the only way to remove it is to stop
transferring it -- residency.  So the pass computes

    schedule_size = bus_utilization * C * B

and requires ``total_bytes - schedule_size`` of residency before it places
anything.  Getting this backwards is not a small error: on a model with
``total_bytes`` at 1.4x ``C * B``, a sweep that only prices per-load exposure
reports every load hidden (each one individually is), buys no residency at all,
and runs a third slower than the same graph with a third of the weight resident.

Two budgets, and between them the whole policy
----------------------------------------------

* ``max_resident_bytes`` -- weight bytes handed back to the device permanently.
* ``max_inflight_bytes`` -- weight bytes that may be live in load buffers at once.

They add: the device holds at most ``max_resident_bytes + max_inflight_bytes`` of
weight.  Splitting what used to be a single peak cap is what makes the trade
expressible at all -- but the two are competing for one pool of device memory,
so ``max_device_weight_bytes`` lets the caller name the pool instead and have
the pass split it: the smallest in-flight budget that still hides everything,
and the remainder to residency, which is worth strictly more per byte.

Residency has to be spread, not stacked
---------------------------------------

Which weights become resident matters as much as how many.  Handing the budget
to the largest ones takes them all from the front of the graph and leaves the
back at its original bus-to-compute density, where the loads have nowhere to go;
the step then follows the saturated half.  ``_select_resident`` instead walks the
loads in wait order against a running allowance of ``utilization * B *
prefix[wait]`` and promotes whatever overruns it, which keeps every prefix of the
graph feasible and therefore spreads residency at the density the graph needs.
Short hoists follow from that on their own, and short hoists are what keeps the
in-flight peak small.

Bus occupancy is not live range
--------------------------------

One PCIe stream serializes transfers in *time*, not in snode-index windows.  A
load issued at index ``at`` occupies the bus for ``need`` ns starting when the
compute stream reaches ``prefix[at]`` (or later, if the bus is still busy).  That
interval is what must not overlap another transfer.  The buffer's live range
``[at, last_user]`` is a separate quantity, bounded only by the in-flight byte
budget.

So the sweep books the two separately: a running bus end on the time axis, and
``InflightMap`` on ``[at, last_user]`` in bytes.  Transfers are scheduled in
DEADLINE order and as late as their deadlines allow (see ``_sweep``), which is
what keeps the two from being confused for one another -- a load is hoisted
because the bus needs it earlier, never because the model could not find a
cheaper index.

Residency is spent to the budget, not to zero exposure
------------------------------------------------------

A resident weight does not merely get hidden, it stops crossing PCIe at all:
every step the bus carries ``total - resident`` bytes.  Modelled exposure can
reach zero while the bus is still the real limit -- the model prices one stream
at a nominal bandwidth, and eight ranks pulling from the same host in lockstep
do not get it.  So the buy-out runs in two phases: first the priced one, which
aims the budget at whatever the sweep still cannot hide, then a fill that hands
out the remainder largest-first.  Per byte the bus saving is identical whichever
weight is chosen, so the fill takes the big loads: they dominate the in-flight
peak and the allocator churn that goes with it.
