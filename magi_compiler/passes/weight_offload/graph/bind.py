"""Tag already-parked weights, and load them back inside the graph.

Weights reach the host pool only through host-first materialization
(``reserve`` + ``adopt``).  Two steps, deliberately separate:

``bind_weights_to_host``
    asks the source which parked weights the graph should load, intersects
    the pick with peers in each shard group (per-candidate, not WORLD-wide
    all-or-nothing), and tags the graph.  Nothing about the graph's shape
    changes, and no bytes move -- a failure here is a no-op.

``insert_h2d_loads``
    splices ``magi::h2d_load`` + ``wait_tensor`` in behind each tagged weight,
    one load per weight.  The load goes ABOVE every reader of that weight, so
    anything the graph did to it -- a dtype cast, an uneven-shard pad -- still
    runs on the device: casting on the host would both burn CPU and, for a
    fp32-master/bf16-forward weight, double the bytes crossing PCIe.

    Loads are not merged.  A submission costs ~25us of CPU on top of the copy,
    which from ~4 MiB up is under the transfer time it rides along with, and
    the size floor keeps smaller weights resident; on gaga4 400B per-weight
    loads ran within noise of loads merged to the all-gather buckets.  A merged
    load would also hold its whole group in flight from the first member's
    deadline to the last member's read.

What a weight *is* belongs to the source (see ``weight_source.py``); everything
here is written once and works for a sharded model and a plain one alike.
