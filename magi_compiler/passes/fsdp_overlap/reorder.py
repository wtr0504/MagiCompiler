"""Latest-safe-launch FSDP all-gather / compute overlap reorder pass.

Installed as the only ``reorder_for_compute_comm_overlap_passes`` entry (replaces
``raise_comms``/``sink_waits``); runs on the whole Inductor graph
(``disable_graph_split=True``).  For each FSDP weight all-gather launch, place it
at the LATEST position whose downstream compute still hides the collective::

    sum(compute runtime between launch and first-consumer) >= comm * scale + margin

Not enough upstream compute -> as-early-as-legal (never worse than raise_comms).

Algorithm: two-pointer back-to-front sweep.  Gathers are visited in reverse
program order; a single compute pointer walks backward continuously and is never
reset, so each gather claims a disjoint run of compute (serializing the single
NCCL stream) and targets only decrease.  All moves are applied in one stable-sort
rebuild and validated once (``_validate_full``) -- the Inductor driver does NOT
repair the returned order, so it must be a valid topological order.

Handles both lowering forms: plain all_gather (1 launch / 1 wait) and coalesced
(1 packed launch + N MultiOutput members moved together as one block + N waits).
