"""``H2dLoadReorder`` placement, on synthetic snode lists.

Phase 1 leaves every ``h2d_load`` directly in front of the wait that guards it,
which is correct and fully exposed; this pass is the one that opens a compute
window in between.  What is worth testing here is the arithmetic of that window
and the in-flight budget that bounds it -- both are pure functions of the snode
list, so the list is synthetic and only the wait predicate is stubbed (Inductor
decides it by ``isinstance``, which no synthetic node can satisfy).

The cost model is deliberately NOT stubbed: a load's window comes from
``bytes / bandwidth``, and getting that unit wrong by 1e9 is the failure mode
this suite exists to catch.
