"""torchrun entrypoint: every rank must make the SAME transport and bucketing
decision for an uneven ``Shard(0)`` weight.

A collective is a joint operation: if one rank keeps a weight gather on NCCL while
its peers move it to the copy engine, the NCCL all-gather waits for peers that will
never arrive and the step hangs.  Nothing in a single rank's graph reveals this, so
it cannot be tested in-process at one rank -- which is why it lives here.

``Shard(0)`` gives ``ceil(F / world)`` rows to the leading ranks and the remainder
to the trailing ones, so with ``F % world != 0`` the ranks do not agree on the local
shard length.  Two decisions were derived from that length and diverged because of
it:

  1. **Transport and bucket membership.**  The lowering pads the short shards up to a
     full chunk, and copy-engine eligibility was decided by asking whether the
     gather's input was the shard itself -- which a pad makes false.  So the trailing
     ranks kept the gather on NCCL and every other rank moved it to the copy engine.
  2. **Symmetric placement.**  A shard's allocation is sized from the local numel, so
     an uneven shard makes it rank-dependent -- and the gather copies one fixed-size
     slab per peer.

The byte cap on bucket size is checked here too, though it never diverged: it was
accounted from the gather's input, which the pad had already brought back to
``chunk``.  It is asserted because that is a coincidence, not a design.

A mixed graph (even and uneven weights interleaved, copy-engine transport) is the
production shape: one odd weight must not drag its even neighbours onto NCCL, and
the even ones must not drag the odd one onto the copy engine.

Checked below, at ``world`` ranks, for an evenly and an unevenly divisible weight:
the full set of gather targets and bucket sizes is all-gathered and compared, and so
is the buffer window size.

Driven by ``tests/feature_tests/test_uneven_shard_transport.py``.  Run directly with::
