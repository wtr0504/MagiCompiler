"""Guard: an uneven ``Shard(0)`` weight must get the same transport on every rank.

A weight gather is a collective, so which transport carries it is a joint decision.
An uneven ``Shard(0)`` is where that decision used to split: the lowering pads the
shards of the ranks that own fewer rows, and copy-engine eligibility was decided from
the gather's input, which the pad changes.  Only the trailing ranks refused the copy
engine; the rest moved on without them and their NCCL all-gather never completed.

The divergence is invisible at one rank -- each rank's graph is individually
reasonable -- so the check has to compare graphs ACROSS ranks, which needs a real
process group and two of them.  The helper runs under ``torchrun`` and all-gathers
its own decisions; this file asserts on its markers.
