"""End-to-end compile-time weight offload on a SimpleFSDP model.

Driven through a ``torchrun`` subprocess (fsdp_overlap_helper/offload_e2e_helper.py)
because the chain needs a process group inside a real compile -- same pattern as
test_fsdp_overlap_e2e.py.

Offload tags whatever host-first parked and the redistribute lowering exposed,
so if the installed SimpleFSDP emits a shape the lowering does not match, there
is nothing to offload and the numeric check would pass on an ordinary graph.
The helper prints ``OFFLOAD_SKIPPED`` in that case and these tests skip rather
than report a green run for a chain that never executed.
