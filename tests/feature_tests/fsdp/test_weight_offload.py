"""Compile-time host offload of SimpleFSDP weight shards.

Three layers, tested separately because they fail in different ways:

* ``host_pool`` -- the bytes actually leave the device, and come back identical.
* ``magi::h2d_load`` -- the copy runs on its own stream and is published as a
  ``Work``, so ``wait_tensor`` is what makes it visible.  An op that silently
  synchronized instead would pass every correctness check and overlap nothing.
* the FX pass -- the load lands ABOVE the dtype cast and BELOW nothing, and the
  gather ends up reading the loaded copy rather than the freed shard.

Uses a 1-rank process group + device mesh (GPU required).
